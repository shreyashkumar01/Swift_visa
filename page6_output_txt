Schengen visa rules allow for stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period across the 29 
Schengen Area member states. To apply, you need a completed application form, a valid 
passport, ICAO-compliant photos, and medical travel insurance, along with proof of purpose, 
f
 inancial means, accommodation, and intention to return. When entering the Schengen area, a 
180-day clock starts, and you must not overstay the allowed duration, which is indicated on the 
visa itself.  
Every visa has a certain validity, and the Schengen visa is no different. You need to be aware of 
your visa's validity. Note that Schengen visas allow you to stay up to 90 days every six months 
(180 days) in Schengen countries. 
The rule is non-negotiable. Hence, ensure that your visa is valid for the entire duration of your 
stay. If you are found with an invalid visa, you might need to pay stiff penalties. In the worst-case 
scenario, you might face bans on future travel in countries located in the Schengen area.
