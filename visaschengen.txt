------------------------------------------------  
- The *Schengen Area* covers 29 European countries. 0  
- Schengen visas are broadly divided into:  
  1. *Short-stay visas (Type C)* — for tourism, business, family visits, transit, etc. 1  
  2. *Long-stay / National visas (Type D)* — for work, study, or residence in a specific Schengen country. 2  
- Some visas are “uniform” (valid across all Schengen countries), while others may have limited territorial validity. 3  
- Applications typically go through embassies/consulates or outsourcing centers (VFS, etc.).  

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Key 2025‑Specific / Recent Updates
