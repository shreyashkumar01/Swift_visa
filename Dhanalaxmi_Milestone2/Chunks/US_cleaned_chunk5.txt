times. fortunately, the u.s. government has implemented automation in several visa processing stages to streamline timelines. average processing times by visa type: tourist/business visas (b1/b2): these typically take 2 to 6 weeks, including appointment scheduling, biometrics, and interview. in peak seasons, it may stretch to 8 weeks or more. student visas (f1/m1): usually processed in 4 to 8 weeks. early application is advised due to sevis activation and school semester start dates. delays in i-20 issuance can also extend processing. work visas (h1b, l1, o1): these can take 3 to 6 months, depending on the type and whether you apply for regular or premium processing. premium processing (available for a fee) reduces the timeline to 24 weeks. immigrant visas (green cards): processing ranges from 6 to 18 months. family preference categories may take longer depending on visa bulletin movements and priority date availability. diversity visa lottery: for winners of the dv program, the process can take 12 to 24 months from selection to visa stamping, due to background checks and interview scheduling.
