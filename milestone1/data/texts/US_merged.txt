Overview
Generally, a citizen of a foreign country 
who wishes to enter the United 
States must first obtain a visa, either a 
nonimmigrant visa for a temporary stay 
or an immigrant visa for permanent 
residence.  The visa allows a foreign citizen 
to travel to a U.S. port of entry and 
request permission of the U.S. immigration 
inspector to enter the United States. 
A “visitor” visa is a nonimmigrant visa 
and generally is used to enter the United 
States temporarily for business (B-1), for 
pleasure or medical treatment (B-2), or a 
combination of these purposes (B-1/B-2). 
Business Visitor Visas (B-1) - If the 
purpose of the planned travel is business 
related, for example, to consult with 
business associates, attend a scientific, 
educational, professional or business 
conference, settle an estate, or negotiate a 
contract, then a business visitor visa (B-1) 
would be the appropriate type of visa for 
the travel.  For more details on these and 
other activities that you can undertake 
while in B-1 status, visit travel.state.gov to 
see the handout on “Business Travel to the 
United States.”
Personal or Domestic Employees: Under 
immigration law, qualified personal or 
domestic employees may travel to the 
United States as business visitors under 
certain circumstances when accompanying: 
1) a U.S. citizen employer who lives 
permanently outside the United States 
or is stationed in a foreign country and 
is visiting or is assigned to the United 
States temporarily; OR 2) a foreign citizen 
employer in the United States who is in 
B, E, F , H, I, J, L, M, O, P , or Q nonimmigrant 
visa status. 
Important Notice: The William 
Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection 
Reauthorization Act (WWTVPA) of 
2008 requires that an individual applying 
for a B-1 domestic employee visa be 
made aware of his or her legal rights 
under federal immigration, labor, and 
employment law. Y ou will find information 
on your rights and protections on  
travel.state.gov.  
Pleasure, T ourism, Medical 
Treatment - Visitor Visas (B-2) - If 
the purpose of the planned travel is 
recreational in nature, including tourism, 
visiting friends or relatives, rest, or is 
related to medical treatment, activities 
of a fraternal, social, or service nature, or 
participation by amateurs who will receive 
no remuneration in musical, sports and 
similar events or contests, then a visitor 
visa (B-2) would be the appropriate type 
of visa for the travel.  Persons planning to 
travel to the United States for a different 
purpose including students, temporary 
workers, crew members, or journalists, 
must apply for a different category of visa. 
Y ou will find additional information on B-2 
requirements on travel.state.gov.
Note: Representatives of the foreign 
press, radio, film, journalists or other 
information media, engaging in that 
vocation while in the United States, 
require a nonimmigrant Media (I) visa and 
cannot travel to the United States using a 
visitor visa or on the Visa Waiver Program.
Visa Waiver Program
Travelers coming to the United States for 
tourism or business (B-1 or B-2 category 
visa) purposes for 90 days or less from 
qualified countries* may be eligible to 
travel without a visa if they meet the Visa 
Waiver Program (VWP) requirements. 
Currently, 38 countries* participate in the 
VWP .  For a list of participating countries* 
and additional information on VWP 
requirements, see the Department of 
State’s travel.state.gov website.
*With respect to all references to “country” 
or “countries” on this page, it should be noted 
that the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Pub.

Qualifying for a Visitor Visa
There are specific requirements which 
must be met by applicants to qualify for 
a visitor visa under U.S. immigration law.  
The consular officer at the embassy or 
consulate will determine whether you 
qualify for the visa. 
The required presumption under 
U.S. law is that every visitor 
visa applicant is an intending 
immigrant until they demonstrate 
otherwise.  Therefore, applicants 
for visitor visas must overcome this 
presumption by demonstrating:
• That the purpose of their trip is to 
enter the United States temporarily 
for business or pleasure; 
• That they plan to remain for a 
specific, limited period; 
• Evidence of funds to cover expenses 
in the United States; 
• That they have a residence outside 
the United States as well as other 
binding ties that will ensure their 
departure from the U.S. at the end 
of the visit. 
Applying for a Visitor Visa
Applicants for visitor visas should 
generally apply at the nearest U.S. 
Embassy or Consulate in the country 
where they live.  It is important to apply 
for a visa well in advance of the travel 
departure date. 
As part of the visa application process, 
an interview at the embassy or consulate 
consular section is required for visa 
applicants aged 14-79, with some 
exceptions.  For example, persons age 
13 and younger and age 80 and older 
generally do not require an interview, 
unless requested by the embassy or 
consulate.  Check the website of the 
U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home 
country for details.
Making the appointment for an interview 
is the first step in the visa application 
process.  The wait time for an interview 
appointment for applicants can vary, so 
early application is strongly encouraged.  
Visa wait times for interview 
appointments and visa processing times 
for each U.S. Embassy or Consulate are 
available on travel.state.gov and on most 
U.S. Embassy or Consulate websites. 
Y ou can learn how to schedule an 
appointment for an interview, pay 
the application-processing fee, review 
embassy-specific instructions, and much 
more by visiting the website of the U.S. 
Embassy or Consulate where you will be 
applying.  Y ou will find a list of all embassy 
or consulate websites at usembassy.gov.
Y ou will need to complete the electronic 
application form DS-160 before your 
interview. During the visa application 
process, an ink-free, digital fingerprint 
scan will be taken. Some visa applications 
require further administrative processing, 
which takes additional time after the 
visa applicant’s interview by a Consular 
Officer.  For information about required 
documentation and fees, please visit 
travel.state.gov.
Additional Information
No assurances regarding the issuance of 
visas can be given in advance.  Therefore 
final travel plans or the purchase of non-
refundable tickets should not be made 
until a visa has been issued. 
• Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is 
valid until its expiration date. If your 
passport expires, you may use the 
expired visa for travel and admission 
to the United States along with 
your new valid passport containing 
the same biographic data.  Do not 
remove the visa page; instead carry 
both passports together. 
• Visitors are not permitted to accept 
unauthorized employment during 
their stay in the United States. 
Visa Denials
• If the consular officer finds it 
necessary to deny the issuance of a 
visitor visa, the applicant may apply 
again if there is new evidence to 
overcome the basis for the refusal.  
For additional information on visa 
denials, go to travel.state.gov.
Further Visa Inquiries
• Questions on post-specific visa 
application procedures and visa 
ineligibilities should be made to 
the U.S. Embassy or Consulate 
where you will be applying.  Before 
submitting your inquiry, please be 
sure to review travel.state.gov and the 
particular embassy or consulate’s 
website.  
• If your inquiry concerns a visa case 
in progress overseas, you should 
first contact the U.S. Embassy or 
Consulate handling your case for 
status information.  If, after reviewing 
travel.state.gov, you have further 
questions, contact Visa Services.

FOREWORD 
 
This document has been developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in response to 
concerns that technical experts from the People’s Republic of China have been denied entry visas to the 
United States for attendance at technical committee meetings of the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) or the International Organization for St andardization (ISO).  It is intended to assist 
meeting sponsors and Technical Committee leaders in their communication with potential meeting 
participants from outside the U.S. on visa processing requirements and to give readers a better 
understanding of the process, care and time needed for Chinese experts or business guests to make a 
successful visa application.  Also included are links to various Embassy  or Consulate resources that will 
simplify the job of communicating correct and useful information related to obtaining a visa.   
 
The information resources that follo w include materials compiled from the American Embassy in Beijing 
and from the U.S. Department of State.    Certain of the tips that are offered are taken from interviews with 
a U.S. Foreign Commercial Servi ce officer who was formerly posted to China and who has significant 
personal experience with business visas from that nation.  Information is current as of January 2005.   
 
Certain elements of this document may also be applicable to other businesses, organizations, educational 
institutions and government agencies that wish to invite delegates from the Peoples’s Republic of China to 
meetings and/or conferences that are being held in the U.S.

1. Introduction 
All individuals who apply at a Consulate or Embassy abroad for a United States entry or re-entry visa are 
screened before the visa is issued, regardless of natio nality.  The U.S. has strict visa laws because it is an 
open society. Unlike many other countries, the nation does not impose internal controls such as registration 
with local authorities on its visitors. Yet, in order to enjoy the privilege of unencumbered travel in the U.S., 
certain requirements must be met.   
 
In particular, a foreign traveler has a responsibility to  prove that he or she is going to return home from 
travel abroad before a visitor visa will be issued.   U.S. consular officers are required by law to view every 
visa applicant as an intending immigrant until the a pplicant proves otherwise.  Section 214(b) of the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Act  states: “Every alien shall presumed to be an immigrant until he 
establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for admission, that he is 
entitled to a nonimmigrant status.”   Though the actual approval rate for first time visa applicants processed 
during 2004 through the U.S. Embassy in Beijing remain s near 70%, most of thos e visa applications that 
were denied were refused under the terms of Section 214(b).

2 U.S. Visa Types for Business Travel 
 
The United States issues two types of visas: Immigrant and Nonimmigrant.   
 
Within the nonimmigrant classification, multiple types of visa classes exist.  “B” type visa referrals are 
appropriate for standardization experts from the People’s Republic of China who are invited to the U.S. to 
participate in either a meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) or the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO), or for those who are invited by U.S. firms as temporary visitors for 
business.    
  
Visa Class – Type “B” Purpose of Travel 
B1 Temporary visitor for business 
B2 Temporary visitor for pleasure 
B1/B2 Temporary visitor for business or pleasure 
 
 [ NOTE:  For a complete list of visa classes, please see Annex A of this document.]    
 
The B1 visa is intended for temporary business travel . This includes such travel as for the purpose of 
negotiating contracts, attending exhibitions and confer ences, short-term training , and consultations with 
suppliers and customers. The B1 visa is not valid for employment in the U.S. 
 
The B2 visa is intended for tourist activities, such as sightseeing, visiting friends and relatives, obtaining 
medical treatment, and attending non-vocational confer ences and meetings. Visitors are not permitted to 
accept employment during their stay in the U.S.  B2 visas are valid for one entry within three months of the 
issuance date. 
 
In some instances, a consular officer may elect to issue a B1 visa jointly with a B2 visa type.  Generally, a 
B1/B2 visa means that while in the U.S. as a business visitor, an individual may attend meetings, and 
participate in them fully, conduct research, and engage in other business negotations. Some B1/B2 visas are 
annotated to note a specific purpose of the trip to the U.S.   
 
NOTE:  Effective January 15, 20 05, qualifying Chinese nationals will receive B1 or B2 type visas that are 
valid for twelve (12) months and multiple entries. Th e previous maximum validity for U.S. visas issued for 
these purposes was only six months. The Chinese Minist ry of Foreign Affairs will issue visas reciprocally 
to U.S. citizens visiting China.  This agreement is in tended to help to ease the burden for businesses that 
have Chinese clients and staff visiting their facilities on multiple occasions during the course of a year.

3 Applying for a B-Type Visa  
After the events of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Department of State introduced changes that have 
lengthened the visa application process.  For example, in addition to the usual Nonimmigrant Visa 
Application (form DS-156), all nonimmigrant visa applicants over the age of 16 must also complete and 
submit the Supplemental Nonimmigrant Visa Application  (form DS-157).  This form is required of all 
applicants, regardless of nationality and regardless of where the applicant applies. 
 
The consular post will conduct an initial review of the application and related documentation and clarify 
any outstanding questions during a subsequent interview. 1   In general, an applicant must be able to 
demonstrate his or her intention to enter the United States for a temporary period and solely for the purpose 
of tourism and/or short-term business. The applicant must also provide evidence of financial ability to 
cover his or her travel expenses to/from and stay in the United States. Finally, he  or she must demonstrate 
sufficiently strong social, economic, and other ties to compel the applicant to return to China after the 
temporary and lawful visit to the U.S.  
 
In addition to the documentation listed below, please be advised that, since March 2004, the U.S. Embassy 
in Beijing has been collecting biometric identifiers such as fingerprints from all nonimmigrant visa 
applicants.  This is related to the U.S. implementa tion of requirements for mach ine-readable passports, 
newer “biometric” passports that contain an identifying  marker such as a fingerprint scan, and U.S. visas 
that contain a bi ometric indicator. A massive new database, the US-VISIT entry and exit control system, 
has also been introduced at major American border crossings.  These measures help to increase the security 
of travel documents and help to ensure that the document holder is a legitimate traveler. 
 
                                                 
1 A nonimmigrant visa applicant who has previously traveled to the U.S. using a B-type visa that (1) expired less than one year ago 
and (2) who is applying for the same type of visa, may drop his/her visa application and application fee receipt at a U.S. Consulate for 
adjudication. The consular officer reserves the right to require such applicants to appear for a subsequent interview if there are 
questions unanswered by the application and supporting documentation.

3.1 Documentation  
Applicants are encouraged to exercise care when co mpleting the requested paperwork.  Issues that may 
cause problems or delays in the visa application process include:  
 The applicant has not spelled his/her name consistently on all documents (passport, visa application, 
supporting documentation). This can cause delays and confusion. The name given on the visa 
application and supporting documentation should be  exactly the same as the name listed on the 
passport. 
 The applicant has not read and followed the tips and guidance on the website of the U.S. consular post 
having jurisdiction over the visa application; this can cause delays or denial. 
 The consular post cannot understand the kind of work the person is doing and officers cannot assess 
the risk/benefit of granting the person a visa. A security clearance will likely be requested if the field is 
unclear.  
 The applicant is from a country cons idered to pose a risk or is working in a field that is considered 
“sensitive” in some way, or if the Consular Lookout (CLASS) system turns up a “hit” on his/her name. 
The consular officers may tell the individual that a Security Advisory Opinion 2 (SAO) is needed. The 
consular post will send the applicant away telling him/her that the Security Advisory Opinion will take

2 A Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) is a request from a consular post to the Department of State in Washington, D.C. to initiate the 
process of requesting clearances from various government agencies and databases including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
Central Intelligence Agency, Drug Enforcement Agency, Department of Commerce, Office of Foreign Asset Control, Interpol, the 
national criminal and law enforcement databases, and others. 
          In January 2005, the State Department issued an updated Technology Alert List (TAL) to overseas consular officials on 
sensitive technology relating to the development of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.  The previous TAL guide resulted 
in too many Chinese applicants being rejected even though their technology interests appeared to be of a non-sensitive nature.

3.2.1 Scheduling an Interview via the Visa Information Call Center  
 
Within China:  4008-872-333 
Overseas:  (86-21) 3881-4611   
International toll charges are solely the responsibility of the caller  
 
In March 2004, the Consular Section at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and at the U.S. Consulates in 
Mainland China implemented a Visa Information Call Center ( http://www.usembassy-
china.org.cn/visa/cal.html) designed to provide callers with easy access and accurate and timely 
information regarding the visa process and improve customer service for visa applicants.  All nonimmigrant 
visa appointments will be made through the Visa Information Call Center.   
 
Services are offered in Mandarin, Cantonese, English,  the Fuzhou dialect and the Taishan dialect.  Pre-
recorded visa information is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Live operators are available from 
07:00 to 19:00, Monday through Friday and 08:00 to 17:00, Saturday.   
 
This is a user-pays service and the charge is 54 RMB (approximately US$7) for twelve (12) minutes or 36 
RMB (approximately US$4) for eight (8) minutes. Any unused minutes can be reused at a later time or 
transferred to another party. Currently, there are th ree methods of payment:  CITIC pre-paid PIN card, 
credit or debit cards. 
 
NOTE:  Some credit card users may need to first re gister with their bank for a program called “pay 
internet” which enables credit card holders to make purchases over the phone.   
 
3.2.2 Non-Appointment Interviews via the Beijing Business Visa Program 
The productive relationships that many consular posts enjoy with local American Chambers of Commerce 
(AmCham) – and similar organizations – help to facilitate the full and timely attention given to visa 
applications submitted by legitimate foreign business travelers, especially those involved in trade, 
negotiations and other dealings with U.S. companies.  As an example, Beijing’s Business Visa Program has 
more than 400 participating companies. Applicants from those companies can apply to a consular officer at 
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing – without an appointment – any morning between 10:00 and noon, once the 
AmCham has notified the Embassy of the applicant’s intention to apply.

3.2.3 Non-Appointment Interviews via the Chengdu Expedited Visa Appointment Program 
In anticipation of a growing need for business travel, the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu launched in December 
2004 a new Expedited Visa Appointment Program for business visa applicants from qualifying American 
Chamber of Commerce company employees. The program a llows a visa applicant to come to the Chengdu 
Consulate without having to make an appointment through the China-wide call center.  
 
Interested companies are encourag ed to contact the Sichuan Ameri can Chamber of Commerce directly 
(amcham@amcham-sichuan.org) to express interest in joining this program and to request an expedited 
appointment letter.  With this letter, an applicant may appear at the Chengdu Consulate from 08:30 to 10:30 
or at 13:00 from Monday to Thursday for an appointment-free visa interview. All other requirements for an 
application, fee receipt and suppor ting documents to indicate the purpos e of the trip and strong ties to 
China apply. Approved applicants will receive their visas after 16:00 the same day. 
 
Only direct employees of companies holding membership in the Sichuan AmCham and that have 
significant business interests in the U.S. may apply for a visa under the program (no distributors, customers, 
family members, etc. are allowed).

3.3 Applicant’s Interview with a Consular Officer 
Applicants are encouraged to arrive at the Embassy or Consulate well before the scheduled appointment 
time.  Business attire is recommended.  For security reasons, cellular phones, cameras, beepers, briefcases, 
luggage and handbags will not be allowed during the interview, nor can anyone accompany an applicant to 
his or her personal interview. 
 
During the interview the consular officer will question the applicant about his or her planned activity in the 
U.S.  It is at this initial stage that clear and concise information about the purpose of the travel abroad 
should be explained and any supporting documentation submitted for review by the consular officer. 
 
For example, delegates to an ISO or IEC technical committee or subcommittee meeting being hosted in the 
U.S. might wish to bring invitation letters, as well as copies of official meeting documents, such as calling 
notices, meeting logistical information (venue, hotel information, etc.) and draft agendas to the interview.   
[NOTE:  See Section 4 of this document for additional information.] 
 
Verbal answers must match the information in the invitation letter or any other supporting documentation 
that had been presented to the consular officer.   Prob lems arise if applicants mi slead or appear to mislead 
the interviewing officer as to their intent in visiting the U.S., which can happen when it appears they cannot 
answer simple questions about their trips. Once it ap pears that a falsification has occured, the consular 
officer will question other information supplied by the applicant.     
 
Throughout the interview, the applicant needs to keep in mind that, even more important than explaining 
why they have been invited to go to the United States, they need to persuasively demonstrate why it is they 
will come back to China.  This can be demonstrated by proving ties in China that would compel them to 
leave the U.S. at the end of the temporary stay.  This might include a high-status job and substantial 
income; national prominence in their field; owners hip of a house, apartment or a car; close family 
relationships or dependents such as children or an elderly parent; a sizeable bank account, and so on.  Well-
organized documentation to prove such ties to China should be available and ready to present if requested 
by the consular officer. 
 
The interview will be short (typically one to three minutes in duration).  Consular officers handle thousands 
of applications every year and are experienced in ma king swift decisions. They will quickly review the 
application form(s) and supporting documents in order to narrow the range in which questions may need to 
be asked.  Much of the necessary information required to make a decision is already supplied on the 
application form itself and in the invitation letter, so there is usually no need for the officer to ask more 
than a few additional questions.    
 
 
More information:  American Embassy in Beijing  
http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa 
Page 13 
 
While consular officers are trained to look at each application individually and consider professional, social, 
cultural and other factors, with younger  applicants consular officers try to look at the applicant’s specific 
intentions, family situations and long-range plans and prospects within his or her country of residence. 
Especially with younger applicants, the reason for mo st refusals is not the documents but the applicant’s 
current overall situation was not adequate to overcome  the presumption that he or she is an intending 
immigrant.   
 
NOTE:  An applicant that has been previously denied may reapply for a nonimmigrant visa at any time.  If 
new information has become available which was not presented to the interviewing officer at the time of 
the first application, or if the applicant’s overall circumstances have changed significantly since the last 
application, a visa may be approved.   
 
 
3.3.1 Submitting Personal Commentary on Visa Cases 
Three times per week, the visa section of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing opens its doors to American citizens 
for the discussion of specific visa cases.  Interested representatives must come prepared for the discussion 
by having the full name(s), passport number(s), and scheduled interview date(s) for each applicant. 
 
The open period operates on a first come-first served basis from 16:00 to 17:00 every Monday, Wednesday, 
and Friday.  All American citizens present by 16:00 w ill have an opportunity to speak to an officer that 
day; anyone arriving after that will only be seen if time permits. Only American citizens are allowed to take 
advantage of this opportunity, not citizens of any other countries or legal permanent residents of the U.S.   
 
Any U.S. organization wishing to comment on a specific visa application but that is unable to reach the 
Embassy directly may send a communication via telefax (+86-10-6532-3178) to the Chief of the Visa 
Section, U.S. Embassy in Beijing.  [ NOTE:  In January 2005, the Chief of the Visa Section is Mr. 
Thurmond Borden.]  
 
The State Department has also established a U.S.-C hina Business Visa Initiative to assist businesses 
seeking visas for clients and partners by providing a dedicated email (businessvisa@state.gov) and 
telephone link (+1.202.663.3198) to visa officials in Washington, DC responsible for China.

3.4 Timing Issues 
Applications should be submitted far enough in advance of  the scheduled travel, but no so far that the visa 
cannot be used before its expiration.  The expiration date of the visa notes the last day a traveler may use 
the visa to apply to enter the United States. The expiration date is not the last day the traveler is allowed to 
remain in the U.S.  
 
Every time a traveler plans to travel to the U.S, he/she must assure that his or her passport is valid for at 
least six months from the time he/she plans to depart th e U.S.   A traveler may tr avel with two passports – 
one expired passport with a valid visa and a new passport.  Applicants are also encouraged to allow 
sufficient time for such actions as obtaining a passport from the Chinese government.

4 Issuing Invitations to Chinese Nationals to Atte nd  IEC or ISO Meetings Hosted in the U.S. 
 
Organizations hosting a meeting of ISO or IEC in the United States, or who wish to invite Chinese business 
partners or customers to the U.S. for meetings, contract negotiations, equipment inspection purchase or 
other business related activities, can provide suppor ting documents for consideration during the visa 
application process.   
 
An invitation letter written on behalf of an applican t can become an essential component of the package 
provided by the applicant for review by the consular officer during the in terview process.  In all cases, the 
letter must be neat, accurate, and credible, and signed by a representative of the official host of the meeting 
that is being held in the United States:   
 
 For meetings of the IEC, a representative of the U.S. National Committee of the IEC (USNC/IEC) will 
prepare the invitation letter. 
 
 For meetings of the ISO, a representative of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) will 
prepare the invitation letter. 
 
Delegates who request an invitation letter from the US NC/IEC or from ANSI are requested to provide the 
following information: 
 
 Name (as shown on the passport) 
 Passport number 
 Date of birth 
 Employer and title   
 Contact information (address; telephone; telefax and e-mail address) 
 
The invitation letter will include contact information (telephone, telefax and e-mail address) for the 
appropriate USNC/IEC or AN SI contact person should the interviewing officer has further questions.  If 
available, relevant meeting documents – such as a draft agenda – will also be included. 
 
The requesting delegate will receive a signed copy of  the invitation letter via telefax or hard-copy mail 
(airmail) and an un-signed copy via e-mail.

Each applicant or group of applicants must present his/her/their own application materials. If a particular 
document has not been given to the applicant(s) to pres ent to the officer at the time of interview, assume 
the officer has not seen it.

5 Visa Facilitation Initiatives  
 
Public outreach continues to be the key component of the U.S. State Department’s efforts to facilitate 
business travel and educate the American and interna tional business community about the visa process.  
The U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affa irs (CA) has introduced some significant changes to 
help facilitate travel and make the visa process more  transparent. For instance, interagency discussions 
recently yielded a much-improved Visas Mantis SAO (Security Advisory Opinio n) process; processing 
times have shortened considerably, and the process is more predictable. Also, the amount of visa data 
published on State Department websites has been increased.  
 
In an October 20, 2004, memorandum from then-Secretary of State Colin Powell to Special Embassy Posts 
on the subject of facilitating business travel, the former  Secretary expressed his commitment to ensure that 
posts have the resources necessary to achieve his goal of “Secure Borders, Open Doors” and highlighted 
some of the most common and effective facilitation initiatives in place worldwide: 
 
Formal Facilitation Programs 
Many posts have established formal facilitation programs that enroll major companies and permit their 
employees to obtain expedited appointments, and/or expedited processing on the day of the interview. 
Typically, companies must meet strict ly established criteria in order to be enrolled, and must adhere to 
strict standards to stay in the program. Site visits are often critical to determine a company’s eligibility. 
While membership in these programs commonly is limited to companies that are members of host 
country’s American Chamber of Commerce (AmCha m), many posts enroll non-AmCham companies as 
well. Variations of membership include only allowing participation by employees of companies that have 
been members of AmCham for at least one year, or limiting it to individuals applying for visas for business 
purposes, as opposed to those applying to visit the U.S. for tourism. Common characteristics of formal 
programs include:  
 
 Collecting examples of each company’s letterhea d and the signatures of  authorized company 
representatives for comparison purposes. Some posts  make available to offi cers at their desktop an 
electronic database of member companies’ profiles,  including scanned images of its letterhead and 
signatures. 
 
 Allocating a specific number of visa appointments daily to businesspeople applying through the 
program. One mechanism to trigger expedited appointments is assigning companies specific codes, and 
requiring applicants to indicate such codes when scheduling an appointment. Posts allowing walk-ins 
usually require applicants to present a letter issued by an authorized representative of their company.

http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa 
Page 19 
 
 
Group Appointments 
Many posts expedite appointments for groups and/or schedule group appointments, and establish specific 
time blocks when business groups may appear for interview. 
 
Time Block Set-Asides 
Specific time blocks may be set aside weekly to allow ce rtain categories of applicants to appear without an 
interview. Categories may include all petition-based applicants, applicants with B visa referrals, individuals 
traveling on U.S. Government (USG)-sponsored trips,  government and military officials of a certain rank, 
and more. 
 
Business Facilitation Units 
Many posts assign specific officers and/or establish busin ess facilitation units to serve as a point of contact 
for the business community. This may include establis hment of special e-mail addresses and/or phone 
numbers to address questions from the business community and dispense information on the visa process. 
 
Training 
Regular business visa training for consular officers addresses a country’s economic conditions, provides 
information on the structure of the country’s bu siness community, and discusses business-interviewing 
techniques. The training usually is coordinated by the consular and economic or commercial sections, and 
may also include representation from the front office and public diplomacy section. 
 
 
 
Recognizing that certain posts’ ability to facilitate bus iness travel is impacted by larger foreign policy 
issues, all CA posts were encouraged to employ one  or more of the initiatives described above while 
retaining the flexibility to accommodate urgent requests for appointments when appropriate.

6 Business Passports 
 
A Chinese national who wishes to travel with a business passport (i.e., a passport issued through his or her 
company and with only a two-year validity), will be required to follow somewhat different procedures than 
described in this document.  
  
In general, most Chinese companies will develop a vi sit plan for the next calendar year no later than 
December 31 of the preceeding year. An expert who wish es to attend a meeting or event abroad and travel 
on a business passport should submit his or her request in the visit plan being considered by his or her 
company.  The company’s visit plan will then be subm itted to the relevant authority for consideration and 
approval.  This authority might be a Ministry, City Government or Industry Association that has been 
authorized by the Central government to conduct foreign affair matters.   
 
Upon approval of the company’s plan, this authority w ill be responsible for assisting individual applicants 
with preparations for their visit(s)  abroad. This assistance will include an explanatory letter to the U.S. 
Embassy that clearly indicates who will bear the travel er’s expenses while in the U.S., who is sending the 
expert, who invited the expert and for what purpose.   
 
The competent authority will submit to the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs the entire visa application package 
(as prepared by the traveler), including the other required documents described earlier in this text.  The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send all documents concerned to the U.S. Embassy and will advise the 
employee of the interview date.  If the visa application is approved, the Ministry will collect the approved 
visa from the U.S. Embassy on behalf of the Chinese applicant.  
 
Experts who are interested in learning more about th is procedure are encouraged to contact the relevant 
department within their own company.

U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING – DOCUMENT CHECKLIST AND GUIDANCE 
(2025) 
 
Source basis: This guide is based mainly on official U.S. government information about F‑1 
and M‑1 student visas from the U.S. Department of State (travel.state.gov), the Student and 
Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP/SEVIS), and additional guidance from U.S. universities and 
consular resources. It is written in simplified language for learning and “visa screening” 
purposes and is not legal advice. Always check the latest information from official U.S. 
government websites and your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate before applying. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
1. OVERVIEW OF U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
When someone applies for a U.S. student visa, consular officers and immigration systems 
carry out several layers of checks. For most full‑time international students, this is the F‑1 
visa (academic study) or M‑1 visa (vocational or technical training). J‑1 visas are used for 
exchange programs and have similar, but slightly different, rules. 
 
Visa “screening” means verifying that the applicant: 
 
• Has been admitted to an approved school and issued the correct SEVIS document. 
• Intends to study a genuine, full‑time course and meets the academic and English‑language 
requirements. 
• Can pay tuition fees and living expenses without working illegally. 
• Plans to follow U.S. immigration rules and leave or change status legally when the 
program ends. 
• Does not present security, public‑safety, or public‑health risks. 
• Has provided complete and truthful information on all forms. 
 
The screening process uses documents uploaded by the student, information in the DS‑160 
online visa application, SEVIS records, biometrics, security databases, and the in‑person visa 
interview. A visa‑screening system must therefore pay special attention to both documents 
and consistency across all data fields. 
 
This document focuses on F‑1 visas applied for outside the United States, but most elements 
also apply to M‑1 and to J‑1 student/exchange visas with minor changes. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
2. CORE DOCUMENTS FOR A U.S. STUDENT VISA 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
2.1 Form DS‑160 – Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application 
 
Every nonimmigrant visa applicant must complete Form DS‑160 online and submit it 
electronically. The form collects personal data, travel plans, education history, work history, 
family information, previous travel to the U.S., security questions, and social‑media 
identifiers. 
 
Key screening points: 
 
• DS‑160 Confirmation Page: After submission, the system creates a confirmation page with 
a barcode. The applicant must print or save this page and bring it to the interview. 
• Accuracy and consistency: Details (name, date of birth, passport number, school name, 
SEVIS ID, address, etc.) must exactly match the passport, Form I‑20, SEVIS record, and any 
university letters. 
• Security and background questions: Answers to questions about crime, immigration 
violations, terrorism, health issues, and previous visa refusals must be truthful. Mismatches 
between DS‑160 answers and security databases can lead to refusal or permanent 
ineligibility. 
• Social‑media handles: Recent rules require applicants to list social‑media usernames used 
in the last several years. Officers may review online content as part of security vetting. 
 
A visa‑screening engine should cross‑check DS‑160 data with other documents and flag any 
inconsistencies (for example, different dates of birth, different spellings of the school name, 
or undeclared previous refusals). 
 
2.2 Valid passport 
 
Applicants must hold a passport that: 
 
• Is valid for at least six months beyond the intended date of entry to the U.S. (unless 
exempted by a specific agreement between the U.S. and the applicant’s country). 
• Shows the correct spelling of the applicant’s name in Roman letters. 
• Has at least one or two blank pages for the visa foil and entry stamps. 
 
For screening, verify that the passport is not expired, not damaged, and matches the identity 
details on DS‑160 and SEVIS. 
 
2.3 Form I‑20 (for F‑1/M‑1) or DS‑2019 (for J‑1) 
 
Form I‑20 is issued by a Student and Exchange Visitor Program–approved school for F‑1 or 
M‑1 students. It contains: 
 
• Student’s name, date of birth, SEVIS ID number. 
• School information and school code. 
• Program start and end dates. 
• Program level and field of study. 
• Tuition fees and estimated living expenses. 
• Details of any scholarships or school financial support. 
 
Key screening checks for I‑20: 
 
• SEVIS ID on the I‑20 matches the DS‑160 and the SEVIS payment receipt. 
• Program start date is in the future, and the visa is requested within the allowed time 
window (you can generally apply up to 365 days before the program start, but you may 
enter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before that date). 
• The program is full‑time and at an appropriate educational level. 
• The financial information on the I‑20 (costs and funding sources) is consistent with the 
financial documents submitted. 
 
For J‑1 programs, DS‑2019 plays a similar role, listing program sponsor, category, and 
funding information. 
 
2.4 SEVIS I‑901 fee payment receipt 
 
Before a visa interview, most F‑1, M‑1 and J‑1 applicants must pay the SEVIS I‑901 fee and 
print the payment confirmation receipt. This fee supports the Student and Exchange Visitor 
Information System used to track students and exchange visitors in the U.S. 
 
Screening points: 
 
• SEVIS ID on the receipt must match the SEVIS ID on Form I‑20/DS‑2019. 
• The payment date should be before the interview. 
• If a student changes school and receives a new I‑20 with a new SEVIS ID, a new SEVIS fee 
may be required unless the rules allow a transfer of the previous fee. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
3. INTERVIEW APPOINTMENT, PHOTO AND MRV FEE 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
3.1 Visa application (MRV) fee payment 
 
Most applicants pay a Machine‑Readable Visa (MRV) fee before scheduling the interview. 
Procedures vary by country but usually involve creating an online profile, paying the fee, 
and then selecting an appointment slot. 
 
Screening system tasks: 
 
• Record the MRV payment confirmation number and date. 
• Check that the barcode number on the appointment confirmation matches the DS‑160 and 
profile. 
 
3.2 Digital photo 
 
U.S. visa photos must follow strict rules for size, background, face position, and recency. 
Often the photo is uploaded as part of the DS‑160, and sometimes you must bring a printed 
copy to the interview. 
 
A screening engine can check that: 
 
• A photo was successfully uploaded. 
• The photo meets basic specifications (for example, square aspect ratio, no heavy editing). 
• The same photo (or a recent one) appears in the application profile to reduce identity risk. 
 
3.3 Appointment confirmation 
 
Applicants must bring the interview appointment confirmation page. While this is not a 
“screening” document for immigration rules, missing it can prevent access to the consulate. 
A comprehensive system may still track it so that checklists shown to students are 
complete. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
4. FINANCIAL EVIDENCE FOR STUDY IN THE U.S. 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
A major part of U.S. student visa screening is verifying that the applicant can afford their 
education without working illegally or relying on public funds. 
 
4.1 How much funding is required? 
 
The minimum funding is usually based on the school’s estimate of: 
 
• Tuition and required fees for one academic year (or the whole program if shorter), and 
• Estimated living expenses (housing, food, insurance, books, etc.) for 9–12 months. 
 
These estimates appear on the I‑20 or DS‑2019. Some consulates also publish rough funding 
guidelines. Students must show they have enough money from acceptable sources to cover 
these costs for at least the first year, and often must indicate a plausible plan for the entire 
program duration. 
 
4.2 Types of acceptable financial documents 
 
Common evidence includes: 
 
• Bank statements or bank letters for personal savings accounts. 
• Fixed deposits or certificates of deposit that can be liquidated. 
• Scholarship letters from the school or external sponsors. 
• Approved educational loan letters. 
• Evidence of sponsor income such as salary slips, tax returns, or business registration if the 
funds come from parents or relatives. 
 
The screening system should verify that: 
 
• The documents clearly show the account holder’s name, institution name, account 
number, and currency. 
• Balances are sufficient to meet or exceed the required amount when converted to U.S. 
dollars using an appropriate rate. 
• Funds appear stable and legitimately obtained rather than sudden unexplained large 
deposits immediately before the visa interview. 
• If multiple sponsors are used, the combined funding still meets the requirement and each 
sponsor’s relationship to the student is documented. 
 
4.3 Sponsor relationship and intent 
 
In many countries, parents or close relatives act as financial sponsors. Officers will look for: 
 
• Proof of relationship (birth certificates, family registers, etc., if requested). 
• A reasonable link between the sponsor’s income and the promised funding. 
• A logical explanation of why the sponsor is willing and able to support the student. 
 
For visa‑screening logic, flags should appear when income seems inconsistent with savings, 
or when the sponsor is a distant acquaintance with no clear reason to provide large sums. 
 
4.4 Common financial refusal patterns 
 
Typical reasons for denial related to finance include: 
 
• Insufficient funds to cover tuition plus living costs. 
• Use of documents from unregulated banks or unverifiable financial institutions. 
• Over‑reliance on funds that are not easily accessible (for example, property valuations 
without a loan or sale). 
• Financial stories that conflict with the student’s stated background or DS‑160 answers. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
5. ACADEMIC, ENGLISH AND STUDY‑PLAN EVIDENCE 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
5.1 Admission letter and academic documents 
 
Although the primary official record of admission is the I‑20 or DS‑2019, students usually 
bring: 
 
• University admission or offer letter. 
• Academic transcripts and diplomas (school, college, previous university). 
• Standardized test scores (such as TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT) if required by 
the school. 
 
These documents help show that the student is academically prepared. 
 
Screening checks: 
 
• The course details in the admission letter are consistent with the I‑20 (program name, 
level, start date). 
• Academic history in DS‑160 matches the transcripts and qualifications supplied. 
• Any gaps in education or work history are explained. 
 
5.2 English‑language ability 
 
For most academic programs, U.S. schools set minimum English‑language requirements. 
The consular officer may also informally evaluate English during the interview. Poor 
language ability may raise doubts about whether the student can follow the course and 
whether the offer of admission is genuine. 
 
A screening engine can: 
 
• Record test names, scores, and test dates. 
• Compare scores with program requirements. 
• Flag missing or expired English‑language evidence for schools that normally require it. 
 
5.3 Study plans and career goals 
 
During the interview, officers often ask why the applicant chose that particular course, 
university and country, and how the education fits into their long‑term plans. There is no 
separate document for this, but consistency between the personal statement provided to 
the university, DS‑160 answers, and interview responses is crucial. 
 
From a visa‑screening perspective, large mismatches (for example, weak academic history 
but very expensive, unrelated course with vague career plan) may signal higher refusal risk. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
6. NONIMMIGRANT INTENT AND TIES TO HOME COUNTRY (INA 214(b)) 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
Under section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, most nonimmigrant visa 
applicants are presumed to be intending immigrants unless they can convince the officer 
that they will respect the terms of their visa and leave the U.S. or change status lawfully at 
the end of their permitted stay. 
 
For students, this means demonstrating both: 
 
• A credible plan to study full‑time and follow status rules; and 
• Strong connections (“ties”) outside the U.S. that make it likely they will leave after study, 
such as family responsibilities, career prospects, property, or business. 
 
6.1 Typical “ties” evidence 
 
Applicants may bring informal supporting documents such as: 
 
• Evidence of family living in the home country (family registers, residence documents). 
• Proof of owned property or long‑term tenancy. 
• Letters from employers noting future job opportunities after graduation. 
• Business registration certificates or partnership documents. 
• Previous international travel history showing they respected visa rules in other countries. 
 
These documents are not always requested, but they can help in borderline cases. A 
decision‑support system could store such evidence metadata and mark applications where 
ties appear weak, which may require extra preparation for the interview. 
 
6.2 Common 214(b) refusal patterns 
 
Frequent reasons for refusal under 214(b) include: 
 
• Inability to explain why the chosen course and university make sense for the applicant’s 
background. 
• Very weak career plans or unrealistic expectations about working long‑term in the U.S. on 
a temporary student visa. 
• Inadequate financial situation combined with an expensive course. 
• Major inconsistencies between DS‑160, documents and interview answers. 
• Lack of clear connections to the home country or evidence of plans to remain in the U.S. 
permanently without an immigrant visa route. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
7. SECURITY, PUBLIC‑SAFETY AND PUBLIC‑HEALTH SCREENING 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
7.1 Security and criminality checks 
 
Information from the DS‑160, biometrics appointment and other databases is used to run 
checks for criminal records, terrorism links, previous immigration violations, and other 
security concerns. Officers and automated systems look for: 
 
• Past arrests or convictions, especially for serious offences. 
• History of overstaying visas or working without authorization. 
• Inconsistencies in identity information that suggest fraud. 
 
Most of these checks use government databases and are not visible to the applicant. 
However, a visa‑screening tool for training purposes can simulate this by including 
questions about previous refusals, travel history and any legal incidents. 
 
7.2 Social‑media and digital‑footprint review 
 
Recent policy requires applicants to list social‑media handles. Consular posts may review 
public social‑media content for signs of: 
 
• Support for violence or terrorism. 
• Clear fraud (for example, posts contradicting stated employment or study plans). 
• Involvement in scams or visa‑selling schemes. 
 
Students should assume that anything they post publicly could be considered, and a 
screening checklist can remind them to ensure their online presence matches the story in 
their application. 
 
7.3 Medical and vaccination issues 
 
Most student visa applicants do not need a full immigrant‑style medical exam, but they must 
truthfully answer DS‑160 questions on communicable diseases, harmful behaviour and 
drug use. Later, when applying for student health insurance or when entering the U.S., they 
may need to show vaccination records or undergo health checks required by the school. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
8. BIOMETRICS, INTERVIEW AND PORT‑OF‑ENTRY SCREENING 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
8.1 Biometrics collection 
 
Many countries now use a two‑step process: 
 
• Biometrics appointment at a visa application center, where fingerprints and a digital 
photograph are captured. 
• Visa interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. 
 
Biometrics link the applicant’s identity to their DS‑160 data and enable checks against U.S. 
and international databases. A screening system should confirm that the biometrics 
appointment is scheduled/completed before the interview date. 
 
8.2 Visa interview 
 
The visa interview is the core of the screening process. The officer has access to: 
 
• DS‑160 responses. 
• SEVIS data and I‑20 information. 
• Previous U.S. visas and travel history. 
• Security and risk‑assessment tools. 
 
During the interview, the officer may ask questions about: 
 
• The chosen program and university. 
• Funding sources and how the family earns money. 
• Ties to the home country and future plans. 
• Previous travel and visa history. 
• Any unusual items in the DS‑160 or documents. 
 
For a training or RAG‑based screening system, sample interview questions and ideal answer 
patterns can be added as separate knowledge chunks linked to specific risk factors (for 
example, low grades, late program changes, or large unexplained deposits). 
 
8.3 Admission at the U.S. port of entry 
 
Even with a valid visa, a student is separately screened by Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) when they arrive in the U.S. They must carry: 
 
• Passport with valid student visa. 
• Original Form I‑20 or DS‑2019 signed by the school. 
• SEVIS fee payment proof. 
• School contact information and financial evidence, in case CBP asks to see it. 
 
CBP officers decide whether to admit the student and for how long (recorded electronically 
as the I‑94 admission record). A thorough visa‑screening training tool should cover this 
final step and remind students that they must obey CBP’s instructions and verify their I‑94 
details online after entry.

9. HIGH‑LEVEL CHECKLIST FOR A U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING SYSTEM 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
The following checklist summarises the main items a visa‑screening or advisory system 
should verify. Each point can be turned into a yes/no rule, flag, or question to the user. 
 
A. Identity and core records 
1. Passport valid at least six months beyond intended entry. 
2. DS‑160 completed and submitted; confirmation page generated. 
3. Personal details consistent across passport, DS‑160, I‑20/DS‑2019 and school 
records. 
4. SEVIS record active and SEVIS ID consistent across all documents. 
5. SEVIS I‑901 fee paid; receipt linked to correct SEVIS ID. 
 
B. Course and admission 
6. Applicant holds a valid I‑20 (or DS‑2019) from a SEVP‑approved institution. 
7. Program is full‑time and appropriate for the student’s academic background. 
8. Program start date, level, and major make sense and match admission letter. 
9. Standardised tests and academic history support the likelihood of success. 
 
C. Financial sufficiency 
10. School’s estimated annual cost recorded from I‑20. 
11. Sufficient liquid funds shown to cover tuition and living costs for at least one year. 
12. Financial documents are recent, verifiable, and logically connected to the sponsors. 
13. Educational loans, if used, are approved in writing by a recognised lender. 
14. Funding plan for the remaining years (if the degree is longer) is plausible. 
 
D. Nonimmigrant intent and ties 
15. DS‑160 answers and interview preparation show clear plans to return or change status 
lawfully. 
16. Evidence of ties (family, property, career prospects, business) is gathered where 
appropriate. 
17. No major contradictions suggesting the applicant’s real goal is long‑term work or 
immigration via a temporary student visa alone. 
 
E. Security and compliance 
18. DS‑160 security questions answered; no undisclosed arrests, convictions, or 
immigration violations. 
19. Social‑media identifiers provided; online activity does not obviously conflict with stated 
intentions. 
20. Biometrics collected successfully and matched with identity records. 
21. No hits in security databases that would require mandatory refusal without a waiver. 
 
F. Process completion 
22. MRV fee paid; interview scheduled and appointment confirmation available. 
23. Required supporting documents selected according to local embassy/consulate 
checklist. 
24. Applicant understands student‑status responsibilities after arrival (full‑time study, 
reporting address changes, employment limits, etc.). 
25. Port‑of‑entry requirements explained: carry passport, visa, I‑20/DS‑2019, SEVIS receipt 
and school contact details.

10. CONCLUSION AND BEST PRACTICES FOR U.S. VISA SCREENING 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
The U.S. student visa system is structured around three big questions: 
 
1. Are you a genuine student? 
2. Can you afford to study without breaking the rules? 
3. Will you respect the terms of the visa and U.S. law? 
 
Most document requirements and interview questions connect back to these three ideas. 
Many refusals happen not because a student is ineligible, but because the application file is 
incomplete, inconsistent, or poorly explained. 
 
A well‑designed U.S. visa‑screening tool or RAG‑based assistant should therefore: 
 
• Collect all core documents in a structured way (passport, DS‑160 details, I‑20, SEVIS 
receipt, financial evidence, academic records). 
• Automatically cross‑check names, dates, and key numbers to catch mistakes early. 
• Calculate approximate minimum funding requirements and compare them against 
uploaded financial documents. 
• Ask dynamic follow‑up questions based on risk indicators (large recent deposits, frequent 
previous refusals, weak explanation of course choice). 
• Provide customised checklists based on the country of application, visa category 
(F‑1/M‑1/J‑1), and presence of dependants. 
• Offer practice interview prompts and feedback that help applicants give clear, truthful, 
and concise answers. 
• Emphasise honesty and consistency across all stages: university application, DS‑160, 
interview, and arrival at the port of entry. 
 
For real applications, students must always follow the latest instructions from 
travel.state.gov, the SEVP/SEVIS program, and their local U.S. embassy or consulate. 
However, this “U.S. Visa Screening” document offers a detailed conceptual map of the F‑1 
student visa screening process and can be stored as a rich knowledge source within your 
visa‑assistant system.
