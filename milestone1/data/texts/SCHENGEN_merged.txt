following application. The competent authorities shall be entitled to ask for further clarification 
of the grounds for the temporary impossibility.

WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I HAVE TO TAKE WITH ME WHEN I TRAVEL ON A SCHENGEN VISA?

At the external border, visa holders may be requested to produce documents justifying the purpose 
and conditions of their intended stay; that they have sufficient means of subsistence, both for the 
period of the intended stay and for the return to their country of origin or transit to a third state into

than that of which he/she is a national or travelling there to take up residence; AND 
 
(3) You are accompanying the EU/Iceland/Liechtenstein/Norway or Swiss national or planning 
to join him/her for residence.

APPLYING FOR A SCHENGEN VISA 
NEW VISA RULES: Please read the important information in the link, which supplements 
the information below: new_eu_visa_rules_questions_and_answers.pdf 
The Schengen Visa holder can travel to any of the 26 countries using one single visa, thus 
avoiding the hassle and expense of obtaining individual visas for each country. The Schengen 
countries are: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, 
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, 
Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and three non-
EU member states: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. 
In order for applicants to know in which European Embassy they need to apply for a 
Schengen visa, they need to determine the main destination of their journey. The main 
destination is determined by the purpose of the applicants visit: 
For example: 
 If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries for 
equal amount of days, the main destination is the country of point of entry; 
 If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries but 
stay in one country longer than the other, the main destination is the country in which 
the applicant stays the longest period of time; 
 If the applicant intends to visit a Schengen country for a particular purpose (e.g. 
sports, culture) then the main destination is the country in which the purpose is to be 
fulfilled independent of whether other countries are visited first or for a longer period 
of time. 
Applicants may apply for a Schengen visa at the following European Embassies in Port of 
Spain: 
 If the main destination is Estonia, Germany, Italy or Portugal: please apply at the 
Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany; 
 If the main destination is Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, 
Luxemburg, Norway, Poland or Sweden: please apply at the Embassy of the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands; 
 If the main destination is France or Spain: please apply at the Embassy of the 
Kingdom of Spain; 
Travellers to Austria, Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Slovakia, 
Slovenia and Switzerland need to consult with the respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs of 
these countries in order to obtain further information. 
The EU member states that are not in the Schengen area, or are yet to implement the 
Schengen Regulation are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania. Short stay visitors 
to Ireland should check with the relevant authorities of that country to determine whether or 
not they need a visa. 
Travellers who wish to travel to Cyprus and are holders of a valid Schengen Visa (type C, 
single, double or multiple entries) and who have already entered Schengen territory according 
to the stipulations governing the issuance of the Schengen Visa they hold, can travel to 
Cyprus without acquiring a Cypriot Visa. They can stay in the Republic of Cyprus for the 
duration of a period equal to the remainder of the period of legal stay as stated on their 
Schengen Visa and at the latest until the expiration date of their visa. 
Travellers to Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania are advised to contact the respective Ministries 
of Foreign Affairs for information on how to obtain a short stay visa.  
Additional information regarding Schengen visa requirements 
Information for citizens of other countries who legally reside in Trinidad and Tobago: 
Applicants applying for a Schengen visa are required to comply with the EU Visa 
Information System (VIS). The VIS is a system for the exchange of data on short-stay visas 
between Schengen States and it is being progressively deployed, region by region, until all 
Schengen States' consulates worldwide are connected. 
A simple and discreet procedure is carried out directly at the Embassy and only takes a few 
minutes. Visa applicants who are non-nationals and resident in Trinidad and Tobago will 
have to provide their biometric data (a digital photograph and 10 fingerprint scans).  Such 
biometric data, along with the data provided in the Schengen visa application form, will be 
recorded in the VIS central database. The recourse to biometric technology will protect visa 
applicants better against identity theft and prevent false identifications, which in certain cases 
lead to refusal of visa or entry to a person who is entitled to enter. 
Visa applicants will only have to provide such biometric data every 5 years. During this 5-
year period, the fingerprints will be copied from the first visa application, so that frequent 
travellers will only have to complete the procedure once within this period. 
Exemptions from the obligation of fingerprinting are provided for the following categories of 
applicants only: 
 Children under 12, 
 Persons for whom the collection of fingerprints is physically impossible; 
 Heads of State or government and members of a national government with 
accompanying spouses, and the members of their official delegation when they are 
invited by Member States' governments or by international organisations for an 
official purpose.

ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN APPLYING FOR A
SCHENGEN VISA
In 2024, a record-breaking 1.1 million Schengen visas were 
issued in Türkiye.
Difference between Schengen and national visas: 
A Schengen visa is an authorisation issued by a Schengen State that allows 
travellers to enter the Schengen area for:
•Intended short stays in or transit through the territory of a Schengen State 
(short stay visa)
• Transit through the international transit areas of airports of the Schengen 
States (airport transit visa)
Short stays are stays of no more than 90 days within any 180-day period. 
Your visa indicates how long you can stay.
 Other types of visas are governed by the national law of Member States. 
 Every Schengen State decides who enters its territory. Therefore, it is 
important to make sure that you provide the correct information in the visa 
application and when entering the Schengen Area.
 Schengen visa application is a transparent process governed by European 
law: no arbitrary process, no visa refusal for political reasons.
Schengen Member States:
29 member countries: 25 EU Member States and 4 non-EU countries: 
Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
Make your visa process smooth by applying for a visa correctly and by 
the rules. You must fulfill all the listed requirements to ensure a smooth 
process, save time and money. 
 
Visa application is your personal responsibility. You are 
personally responsible for your visa application file. You must have 
your documents in good order and apply for country you plan to visit or 
spend most time in.
Follow these steps 
Submit a complete file. Note that submitting documents which are 
fake/not authentic will lead to a refusal of your visa application.
Apply by yourself and get appointment directly with the 
Embassy/Consulate or the trusted Official External Service Providers in 
case a Schengen state makes use of such a provider as most Schengen 
States do (See the table below.). You have to apply to the Schengen 
State you plan to visit or spend most time in.

Intermediaries/travel agencies are not Official External Service Providers 
authorised by Schengen States and are not associated in any way with 
Embassies or Consulates. Using their services does not increase your 
chances of getting a Schengen visa! Even if you decide to go through an 
intermediator, you have to check your file at every step of the process.
Be aware that the cost of a Schengen visa is at present €90 for adults and 
maximum €45 for children aged 6-12. No visa application fee for children 
aged 0 to 6. An additional service fee is applied by the external service 
providers, which collect applications on behalf of Embassies or Consulates. 
This additional service fee cannot exceed half of the official visa fee.
 
Lodging an appeal against a negative decision might be subject to a fee. 
Reapplication is also possible, but it is important to carefully consider the 
reasons for the previous denial and take the necessary steps to address the 
reasons for refusal.
You do not need a travel agency or any other actor aside for the 
authorised external service providers listed above.
Dos
You should apply in due time
Applications shall be lodged, as a rule, no later than 15 calendar days 
before the start of the intended visit. Begin planning your application up 
to 6 months in advance of your intended visit.
You should apply to the correct country
You must apply to the Official External Service Provider or to the 
Embassy or Consulate of the Schengen country you plan to visit. If you 
plan to visit more than one Schengen country, you have to apply to the 
Embassy or Consulate or the external service provider of the country 
that is your main destination with purpose of stay, or longest intended 
stay. Make sure that you really apply to the external service provider of 
the Schengen country you plan to visit. They are referenced on the 
Embassy or Consulate’s website.
You should provide proof of genuine travel
arrangements
You have to provide genuine hotel reservations and flight reservations 
that match your actual travel plans. It is strongly advised to make 
bookings that can be cancelled or changed without extra cost.
You should verify your invitation details
If invited, you have to ensure the inviter’s contact information is correct.
You should provide complete employment and/or
income details
You have to clearly state your workplace and/or income source.
You should provide proof of financial means
You have to submit bank statements showing sufficient funds for your 
trip, no older than three months.
Personally verify your documents
Check your documents personally before submission to ensure their 
accuracy. Duly sign your application form.
Check your passport's validity
Your passport must be valid for at least three months beyond your 
planned return from the Schengen Area.
Ensure that all the documents you provide
are correct
You have to make sure that all the details in your documents are 
consistent, and correspond to your real plans in the Schengen Area.
What should you do when applying for a
Schengen visa
Things not to do when applying for a
Schengen visa and when using it
Don’ts
Follow the rules and avoid mistakes
Visa applicants who do not follow the rules may have their visa 
application refused, visa revoked, denied entry at the border, or 
unable to benefit from Schengen visa for some time.
You must not seek Schengen visa from the country
that is not your primary destination
You must apply through the Embassy or Consulate of the country 
where you will spend the most time. If you spend equal amounts of 
time in several countries, apply to the country of first entry.
Do not pay extra fees
The cost of a Schengen visa is at present €90 for adults and maximum 
€45 for children aged 6-12. No visa application fee for children aged 0 
to 6. In addition, a service fee may be applied by the Official External 
Service Provider, which collects applications on behalf of Embassy or 
Consulate. Other intermediaries/travel agencies ask for extra fees, 
sometimes significant ones. Using their services does not increase 
your chances of getting a Schengen visa! They do not have better 
access to the Embassies/Consulates. You don’t need to pay for these 
extra fees. Using such agencies is at your own risk. Do not engage 
with fraudulent travel agencies which offer you false promises on 
receiving a Schengen visa against exorbitant additional fees.
Do not block appointment time-slots that you
will not use
Only book one appointment: don’t book any time slots for
appointments that you will not use.
After receiving a visa, do not overstay your visa duration
Your Schengen visa indicates the length of your allowed stay in the 
Schengen Area. This allowed stay is maximum of 90 days in a 180 day 
period. If you exceed this period, your stay becomes irregular. For 
instance, if you received a multiple entry Schengen visa of a long 
duration (1, 2 or 5 years), you can visit the Schengen Area up multiple 
times provided that you do not stay more than 90 days in each period 
of 180 days.
