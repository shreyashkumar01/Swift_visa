German's visa rules depend on your nationality and purpose of travel, but generally require a
valid passport, proof of financial support.
General requirements
• Valid passport: Must be valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay and
have at least two blank pages.
• Proof of funds: You must prove you have enough money for your stay, the amount
depending on your length of stay and accommodations.
• Ties to your home country: You must convince an immigration officer you have ties (like
a job, home, or family) that will ensure you return to your home country.
• Good health: You must be in good health.
• Clean record: You must not have any criminal or immigration-related convictions.
How to determine if you need a visa or eTA
• The requirement depends on your nationality, the type of travel document you have, and
how you are traveling.
