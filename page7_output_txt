Ireland visa rules require a valid passport, clear purpose of visit (tourism, study, work, family), 
proof of funds (bank statements), travel insurance, and a completed online application, with 
specific documents like invitation letters or employment offers needed depending on the visa 
type. All applications are done online via AVATS and submitted to a Visa Application Centre 
(VAC), with processing times varying, and you must provide original documents, including 
certified translations if needed.
If you are travelling to Ireland and you are not a citizen of the UK, Switzerland, or a country in the 
European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein), you may need to 
apply for a visa. 
An Irish visa is a certificate placed on your passport or travel document that allows you to travel 
to Ireland. You still have to present your passport and documents to immigration control when 
you arrive at the airport or port, and an immigration officer may still refuse you entry to Ireland.
