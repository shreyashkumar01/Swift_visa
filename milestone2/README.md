# Milestone 2 — Results & outputs

This folder contains the outputs produced for Milestone 2 of the project.

## Contents
- `outputs/results.json` — JSON file with analysis/results generated by the pipeline.

## How to view the results
- From PowerShell (repo root):

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .\milestone2\outputs\
Get-Content .\milestone2\outputs\results.json -Raw | Out-File -Encoding utf8 -FilePath .\milestone2\outputs\results_pretty.json
code .\milestone2\outputs\results.json
```

- Or open `milestone2/outputs/results.json` directly in VS Code for inspection.

## Notes & next steps
- `results.json` is a snapshot output — regenerate by running the pipeline that produced it (see `milestone1/README.md` for data/indexing steps).
- Next options:
  - Add a small viewer script to pretty-print or filter the JSON (I can add one).
  - Export results to CSV for spreadsheets.
  - Integrate results into the `milestone3` app UI.

If you'd like, I can add a simple script to pretty-print and filter `results.json` now.
